# Glassdoor Scraping Issues Analysis

## üîç **Why Glassdoor is Getting 403 Errors**

### **Root Causes:**

1. **Advanced Anti-Bot Protection**
   - Glassdoor uses sophisticated bot detection systems
   - They analyze request patterns, headers, and behavior
   - IP-based rate limiting and blocking

2. **Cloudflare Protection**
   - Glassdoor likely uses Cloudflare for DDoS protection
   - This blocks automated requests even with proper headers

3. **JavaScript-Heavy Content**
   - Modern job listings are loaded dynamically with JavaScript
   - Simple HTTP requests can't access the actual job data

4. **Geographic Restrictions**
   - Some content might be region-locked
   - Different behavior for different IP locations

5. **Account Requirements**
   - Glassdoor may require login for job searches
   - Guest access is heavily limited

## üõ†Ô∏è **Solutions and Alternatives**

### **Option 1: Use Glassdoor API (Recommended)**
```python
# Glassdoor has official APIs for job data
# Requires API key and proper authentication
# Most reliable but may have costs
```

### **Option 2: Alternative Job Sites**
- **Indeed.com** - More scraping-friendly
- **Naukri.com** - Indian job site, better for local jobs
- **Monster.com** - Another alternative
- **AngelList** - Good for startup jobs
- **LinkedIn** - Our current scraper works better

### **Option 3: Manual Data Collection**
- Use the simplified agent with manual job input
- Collect jobs manually from Glassdoor
- Focus on Apollo.io enrichment

### **Option 4: Proxy and Advanced Techniques**
- Use residential proxies
- Implement CAPTCHA solving
- Use browser automation with stealth plugins

## üéØ **Recommended Approach**

Given the current situation, I recommend:

1. **Focus on LinkedIn scraping** (which works better)
2. **Use alternative job sites** that are more scraping-friendly
3. **Implement manual job input** for Glassdoor jobs
4. **Concentrate on Apollo.io enrichment** (which is working well)

## üìä **Current Status**

- ‚úÖ **LinkedIn Scraper**: Working (with some ChromeDriver issues)
- ‚ùå **Glassdoor Scraper**: Blocked by anti-bot protection
- ‚úÖ **Apollo.io Integration**: Working for company search
- ‚úÖ **Data Processing**: Working perfectly
- ‚úÖ **Report Generation**: Working perfectly

## üöÄ **Next Steps**

1. Fix ChromeDriver issues for LinkedIn
2. Add alternative job sites (Indeed, Naukri)
3. Implement manual job input system
4. Focus on Apollo.io contact enrichment
